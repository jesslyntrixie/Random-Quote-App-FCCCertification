## User Stories (from freeCodeCamp)

- I can see a wrapper element with `id="quote-box"`.
- Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with `id="text"` that displays a random quote.
- Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with `id="author"` that displays the author of the quote.
- I can see a clickable element with `id="new-quote"` that generates a new random quote.
- I can see a clickable element with `id="tweet-quote"` that opens the Twitter intent page to post the quote.
- The quote and author are updated when the "New Quote" button is clicked.
